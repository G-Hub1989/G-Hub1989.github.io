	<h2>Why 3D Printed Jewelry?</h2>
	<p class="article2">ED Designs was created out of an interest and passion to explore new ways of creating jewelry. The design process utilizes the capabilities of 3d printing technology, to quickly create several prototypes and get the design tweaked just right. The inspiration behind all of the designs stems from my architectural background, encompassing my interest in geometric patterns and its ability to create complexity and depth that can easily be turned into wearable art pieces. Each piece is designed  to spice up any outfit, to make a unique and bold statement.<br>
 
	The parts are 3d printed using PLA filament, which is a fully biodegradable thermoplastic polymer consisting of renewable raw materials. The fine lines of the layers, each one less than a quarter of a millimeter thickness adds a dimensional quality to each piece. The result is a very lightweight piece of jewelry, perfect for everyday use.</p>

	<h2>About the Designer</h2>
	<p>My interest in the art of jewelry making started when I was younger, as I always loved to create friendship bracelets and beaded necklaces for my friends and family. whether 3d printed or completely handcrafted iâ€™ve always been fascinated by the unique and bold statement a piece of jewelry can make.<br> 
	 
	It was after going to design school to study architecture, that I realized how similar the art of designing a structure and jewelry design were. Both attend to the needs of the end user, and require the process of iteration to attain a perfect balance of form and function. Having acquired many prototyping skills and methods in school, I quickly became fascinated in 3d printing and its endless capabilities, I noticed that results were quicker and I was able to prototype and see my digitally crafted pieces actualized. My Jewelry pieces reflect my architectural aesthetics, translated through my exploration of geometrical patterns and forms that flatter the body.</p>
